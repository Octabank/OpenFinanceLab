# :chart: OpenFinanceLab

Repository for Open Finance Lab studies.

Open Finance Lab is a project intended to explore economic and finance concepts, focused (but not exclusively!) in Brazilian markets. Although some explorations might look exclusively theoretical, they are meant to be practice driven, and are done in order to test if and how the theoretical result holds.

We have presential meetings every Wednesday at 19pm in C.O.T.I., in Brasília, Brazil.
