# How to Contribute

:sparkles::confetti_ball: **Thanks for contributing!** :confetti_ball::sparkles:

Before implementing new notebooks or scripts, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Octabank/OpenFinanceLab/issues/new) explaining what we should add or change. We can talk there :blush:.

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

Please **don't file an issue** to ask a question. You'll get faster results by joining our [Telegram group](https://t.me/OpenFinLab) and asking there.

If your question is about a lack of clarity of the code or study, consider submiting an issue for better documentation. The next section will explain you how.

## How Can I Contribute?

1. Did you find a mistake or want to suggest another study? First, ensure the suggestion was not already made by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Octabank/OpenFinanceLab/issues/). Lack of proper documentation is also suggested to be filed under [Issues](https://github.com/Octabank/OpenFinanceLab/issues/).

2. If the issue is not suggested, [open a new one](https://github.com/Octabank/OpenFinanceLab/issues/new). Include a **clear title and description**, with as much relevant information as needed.

3. After the issue is created, if you want to resolve it, you can [fork the repository](https://github.com/Octabank/OpenFinanceLab/fork), work there to then submit a pull request.

4. This repository follows [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/):sunglasses: commit standard. Please, follow this standard to provide an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of your commit. And always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
	```
    $ git commit -m ":emoji: A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
	```

## Aaaaand that's it!

Thank you very much for contributing.
